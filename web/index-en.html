	<font color="#c9c9c9">Tyrie Earth is a cartographic server project that I lead in my computer and geomatics science (IG in French) graduation degree. Its goal is to provide somes dynamic, enriched maps of Tyria, the Guild Wars 2 universe in order to present to the novices its regions and to offer a precise and complete tool to the most experienced adventurers to tame its vast territories.
	<br><br>
	Tyrie Earth is aimed at the classical player who wishes to find a missing area or an untraceable remarkable point to finish his exploration as well as the "roleplayer" who will discover some land use layers that will bring much more realism to this univers, and so to enhance the immersion.
	<br><br>
	You can navigate as you see fit on the map and activate or desactivate the different layers to highlight the information you are looking for. This project is still a work in progress and some changes may occur.
	<br><br>
	Feel free to tell me if you find a bug !</font>
